> * It's really Weird that this occurs, maybe there is a real time service protection.
> * The code seems to be working, meaning that the permissions get changed.
> * But the value cannot be changed even if the permissions are changed!
> * I even tried to manually change the permissions and edit the registry field but no luck!

----------------------

> # Requirements
> * Run the Process As Administrator
> * NetFramework 2.0
